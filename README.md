# High resolution violin transcription using weak labels
The violin transcription model and the dataset accompanying the ISMIR23 paper: High resolution violin transcription using weak labels.

The dataset can be found under the **dataset** folder and is comprised of three violin etude books played by 22 violinists. 
We share the open-source MIDI files aligned with each performance. 
The filenames are structured with links to the performances: 
```
{composer}_{catalog_number}_{performer}_{YouTube_ID}_{YouTube_start_sec}_{YouTube_end_sec}.mid
```

The model architecture and the link to the violin transcription model file can be found under the **musc** folder.
